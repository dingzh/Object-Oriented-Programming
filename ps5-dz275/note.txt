One observation from the test input is that, generally speaking, the more
Follow-the-crowd agents in the population, the less rounds it takes to 
reach a consensus. This is more obvious in large populations. It makes sense
cause they are less prone to influence of the minority,making the whole popu-
lation more stable in choices.
